Dynamic Routes and Advanced Models
    - Passing Route Parameters
    - Using Query Parameters
    - Enhance Our Models

Dynamic Routing
    - Add ":" to the express router path to make the route dynamic
        - the value after ":" becomes req.params
        - localhost:3000/:valParam
    - Query params can be passed after a "?" and then chained with "&"
        - localhost:3000/?param=value&b=2
        - accessed with req.query."paramName"

Models
    - Models can hold only static methods (data-storage-friendly)
    - Models can interact with each other (deleting cart items when the product is deleted)
    - Working with files is suboptimal for larger datasets
