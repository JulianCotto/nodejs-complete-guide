MVC Pattern (Model View Controller)
    - All about a separation of concerns
        - Models
            - represent your data in code
            - work with your favor (Save, Fetch)
        - Views
            - what the user sees
            - decoupled from application view
            - shouldn't contain too much logic
        - Controllers (Routes determine with controller code executes)
            - split across middleware functions
            - connecting models and views
            - the 'in-between' logic

Controller should do everything required to connect the model to the view (bi-directional)
